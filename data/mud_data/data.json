      "End of tutorial(#64)\nThanks for trying out this little Evennia tutorial!\n\n\n The game play given here is of course just scraping the surface of\n what can be done with Evennia. The tutorial focuses more on showing\n various techniques than to supply any sort of novel storytelling or\n gaming challenge.  The full README and source code for the tutorial\n world can be found under contrib/tutorials/tutorial_world.\n\n\n If you went through the tutorial quest once, it can be interesting to\n do it again to explore the various possibilities and rooms you might\n not have come across yet, maybe with the source/build code next to\n you.  If you play as superuser (user #1) the mobile will ignore you\n and teleport rooms etc will not affect you (this will also disable all\n locks, so keep that in mind when checking functionality).\nExits: exit back to Limbo(#66)"
